- 👋 Hi, I’m @manovision
- Pre retirement, I was a NASA contractor working in robotics and machine vision, using C++, Assembly, and FPGAs.
- 👀 I’m interested in getting-back to programming, primarily for my own edification.  
- Initial interest is generating a stock trading/financial-analysis software-bot, initially as a fuzzy expert-system and eventually (possibly)  
- in the form of a deep-net.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and fuzzy logic/inference implementations/examples.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above.
